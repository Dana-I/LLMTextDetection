# LLMTextDetection 
# - implementation based on DetectGPT method

# Logprob is the logarithm of the probability of a token being predicted by the model.
# - higher probability: the more confident the model is about the token being the correct next word 
# - logprob closer to zero --> high probability 
# - logprob closer to large negative numbers --> low probability
